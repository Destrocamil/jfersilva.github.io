# Jorge Fernandes
Hey there! I've got a degree in Information Science, topped it off with a post-grad in Software Development. I've got a solid 4 years of experience under my belt, playing around with Linux, automation, configuring stuff, and handling cloud and local infrastructures. I'm all about monitoring, observability, and making things scale smoothly.

By the way, I'm currently rocking it as a DevOps engineer over at Elgato. 🚀

Outside of work, I'm a 'cosplay-as-a-sysadmin' enthusiast in my free time, a wannabe downhill rider when the adrenaline calls, and a gamer for those 'I'm feeling a bit bored' moments. Oh, and being a friend is my full-time gig—always up for a good chat or a laugh!<br><br>

##  Soft skills
At work, I'm all about teamwork, competence, and dedication—I'm always striving for excellence in everything I do!  
In social settings, you'll find me as the funny and talkative one, always up for teamwork and cooperation. I'm all about that team spirit!  
On a personal note, my server might need some maintenance (aren't we all a work in progress?). But hey, I'm always up for a good chat, a nice dinner, or a leisurely walk.  
Oh, and let's talk hobbies! I'm a big fan of cycling, football, and e-Sports—count me in for all the excitement!

**Archivist** @[CEPESE](https://www.cepese.pt/portal/pt) _(2018)_ <br>

At Cepese, I had the opportunity to put into practice and develop skills that had previously been theoretical to me.  
I was a member of a multi-disciplinary team responsible for managing the archive of the Heritage Department at Santa Casa da Misericórdia of Porto. My main tasks included inventory management, description, disposal, and organization of records, as well as the creation of the General Classification Plan.  
During the same period, I was involved in a unique national-level project focused on the transfer of documents from the extinct Civil Governments to the relevant authorities.
Those times hold awesome memories for me! We completed our work on time and achieved great results, and my team was simply amazing!

**Research Fellow** @[FEUP](https://perdigao.fe.up.pt/about) _(2017 - 2018)_ <br>

Windsp.fe.up.pt is a platform created to support the experiments of the NEWA project. I joined the WindsP team during the final stages of my project.  
In WindsP, I was responsible for information and content management, involving the introduction and population of the platform with content, events, documents, and various types of information. Overall, my goal was to bring life and rich content to the platform for professionals in the field, allowing them to access comprehensive information regarding the Perdigão 2017 Field Experiment. This facilitated their understanding of behaviors and changes that might occur within the datasets produced.  
In addition to content and information management, I served as a test subject for my colleagues (the programmers, Daniel and Renato) who were responsible for the new version of WindsP, v03.
